# find_your_flag
## why did I decide to make this website?
I wanted to make a website for people to understand pride flags. I only learned about the pride flags when I was elleven, and I felt left out. I didn't want ANYONE to feel leftout like I did after that. So I decided that I should make a website about different flags and what they mean.
## What did I learn during the process?
- Go wild! Some things aren't meant to go the way as planed.
- Trust your instincts! Its your website, your controll.
- Text vertically! Lets make the text run down, not left to right!
- Rainbows! Time to blend colors.
- Containers! Time to put it in a box.
## Something I wish I knew before I started...
I had a lot of trouble aligning items like pictures. I also wished I knew how to make a hyperlink with an image instead of text as well. Not only these two things being stuff I struglled with along the way, I also had trouble with Cascading Style Sheets as well.
## My next project is going to be...
I want to make a fan website for a game or show that I like. I'm thinking of ti being about Fnaf, or Bfdi and all the other object shows. If i'm going to do the fan website, i'm thinking of making the website list fun facts about the focus, secrets behind the scenes,the resouces these things are coming from, and where to watch/play these games/episodes.
