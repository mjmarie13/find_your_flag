        Queer and Genderqueer are both umbrella terms. Queer in<br>
        general means to be part of the pride community and was used as an<br>
        insult untill the pride community adopted the term, but genderqueer is different.<br>
        Genderqueer is another umbrella term, used to reference people outside the gender binary of female and male.<br>
